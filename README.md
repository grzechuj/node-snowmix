# node-snowmix

*node-snowmix* is a Node.JS library for the excellent [Snowmix](http://snowmix.sourceforge.net/) video mixer. It allows you to create video and audio inputs (feeds), switch between them, and add graphics on top.

## Installation

* This library has been tested on MacOS and Linux
* Snowmix must be [downloaded & installed](http://snowmix.sourceforge.net/Intro/compileandinstall.html)
* The gstreamer command-line, version 1.x, is also required. (Install this via your package manager.)
* Node.JS must be version 6 or higher
* If you haven't got a Node development underway, create one with `npm init`
* Install node-snowmix using npm:

```shell
$ npm i --save node-snowmix
```

## Introduction

Snowmix is tool that's built on GStreamer. Snowmix allows the video & audio so that they can be mixed and changed in real-time. This library, node-snowmix, helps you control Snowmix, and provides methods that make it easy to do common tasks, such as switching video and adding text.

This library models and provides helper functions for *feeds*, *vfeeds* (virtual feeds), *audio feeds*, *texts*, and *images*. Other things (e.g. shapes) can still be handled by sending the relevant Tcl commands.

This library does not currently start Snowmix.
Nor does it help control the (GStreamer) inputs and outputs, though there are some [example scripts](./scripts) to get you going.

# Usage

`node-snowmix` is a class that needs instantiating, using the `new()` method.

```js
let Snowmix = require('node-snowmix'),
    snowmix = Snowmix.new()
```

`port` and `host` can be optionally provided, to override the defaults (which are `9999` and `127.0.0.1`, respectively), e.g.

```js
snowmix = Snowmix.new({ port: 1234 })
```

(Multiple Snowmix instances can be created if you are running multiple Snowmixes on different ports/hosts. If the same host/port is requested multiple times, the same `Snowmix` instance is supplied to prevent multiple identical connections.)

### Sending raw Snowmix commands

Snowmix is controlled by [a range of commands](http://snowmix.sourceforge.net/Documentation/reserved.html).
Use this library to send any Snowmix command with `sendCommand()`:

```js
snowmix.connect()
.then(() => {
    return snowmix.sendCommand('system geometry')
})
.then(response => {
    console.log('System geometry response:', response)
    return snowmix.close()
})
```

However, the real benefit comes when you use the helper functions, which make it easier to provide parameters and understand Snowmix's response. Fore example, geometry can be fetched with:

```js
snowmix.connect()
.then(() => {
    let geometry = snowmix.systemInfo.systemGeometry
    console.log(`The system geometry width is ${geometry.width} and height is ${geometry.height}`)
    return snowmix.close()
})
```

Helper functions around video, audio, text and images are available, and summarised below.

## Video control

In an OO style, video feeds, and virtual video feeds, are given instances of the 'Feed' and 'Vfeed' class (respectively).
Any existing feeds/vfeeds are automatically populated when this library first connects to Snowmix.

Access feeds by ID using `snowmix.feeds.byId(<FEED ID>)`
And likewise, vfeeds with `snowmix.vfeeds.byId(<VFEED ID>)`

All feeds can be accessed with `snowmix.feeds.all()`, and the same for `vfeed`. For example, to see how many vfeeds there are:

```js
snowmix.connect()
.then(() => {
    console.log(`There are ${snowmix.vfeeds.all().length} vfeeds.`)
})
```

To switch to a vfeed (and only that vfeed), use `switch()`:

```js
snowmix.vfeeds.byId(1).switch()
.then(() => { console.log('Enjoy watching vfeed 1!') })
```

This is plain video switching - full-screen switching, nothing more.
(It is hoped to offer more powerful video switching, such as picture-in-picture, in the future.
In the mean time, you can use `sendCommand()` to access all of Snowmix's abilities.)

## Audio control

Audio feeds can also be switched, on the audio mixer. For example, this command switches audio mixer 1 exclusively to audio feed 2:

```js
snowmix.audioMixers.byId(1).switchToAudioFeeds(2)
.then(() => { ... })
```

It is hoped to offer more flexible offers (e.g. volume control) in the future. Until then, if you need it, please raise an Issue, address with a pull request, or work around with `sendCommand()`.

## Text

To overlay text on your video, create a 'Text' object, and then `show()` it.

```js
var myText1 = snowmix.texts.create({ string: 'Snowmix is great!' })
myText1.show()
.then(() => { ... })
```

By default, text will be shown in the bottom-left, black on a translucent grey background.

All fields can be overridden, such as `x` and `y` (to set the location) and `location` (which can be one of `ne`, `nw`, `se`, `sw`).

## Images

To overlay a PNG image on your video, create a 'Image' object, and then create a place for it.

```js
snowmix.images.create({ id: 1, filename: '/path/to/image.png' })
.then(image => {
    return image.addPlace({x: 100, y: 200})
    .then(imagePlace => {
        return imagePlace.show()
    })
})
```

##Â Debugging (including seeing the commands & responses with Snowmix)

To see the commands sent and responses received from Snowmix, and gstreamer, set the ```LOG_LEVEL``` environment variable to ```debug```:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

(Or for even more, set to `silly`.)

## Conclusions, Contributions, Feedback

It is hoped that this library hits the sweet-spot between simplicity (helper functions that get you off the ground quickly) and flexibility (access to Snowmix's commands directly).

Feedback welcome via 'Issues'. Contributions (pull requests) also very welcome.
